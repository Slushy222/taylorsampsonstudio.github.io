                        I continually visited this street in search of continued renewal of a familiar place. 
                        The houses along this street juxtaposed the flanking typologies of urbanization. 
                        I was always under surveillance, always presumed safe. Within these photographs, they present the tension 
                        between access to private and public space, and also access to night-time exploration. </p>

                        I sought to create a blending of two perceptions. One, my place by the river,

                        Through this blend, of soft and dramatic portrayals the piece hinges on photography&apos;s ability to change

                    <p>This project is part of a sustained investigation into research regarding my place in the world. 
                        In this documentary work, there are intimate moments between the figures, self, 
                        and the environment that is thrust upon the work. The photographs bridge the space between the safety of personal 
                        intimacies and their counterparts, being the Christian religion and belief structures. The environmental images, 
                        which have their history tied to many straight and masculine photographers in the medium navigate the tension 
                        within this medium itself. With this contextualization, the work creates a multifaceted space in which many problematic 
                        structures are called into question, and the history associated with men in photography.</p>

                        me and my twin brother. Because this work builds off of the tension between religion and sexuality found in my 
                        Field Work series, I brought in depictions of my brother as a way to examine my masculine ties to photography, 
                        as well as examining more traditional depictions of masculinity that my brother falls into.</p>

                    <h2>digital photomontage, found imagery</h2>  
                    <p>Drawing from Russian Suprematism, my photographic research shifts with the use of photomontage that creates a model that is spatially 
                        disruptive and is in conversation with culture through the use of recycled imagery that is digitally manipulated. 
                        As I am revealing more to myself about the latent space of my internalizations, the work in and of itself is a reveal of a 
                        self-portrait. The digital texturing found throughout the piece discusses older systemic problems in the United States and 
                        its attachment to the contemporary.</p>

                    <h2>digital photography, cyanotypes, t-shirt, vellum, poetry, t-pins</h2>   
                    <p>In the culmination of my photographic research, I present my most vulnerable self. Leading with a main image consisting of a nude self-portrait, 
                        this work is a confrontation with self, environment, and masculinity as a gay man in the southern United States. 
                        The coupled writings and subsequent other transparent images speak to external pressures within the work itself. 
                        The transparency serves as a veil that masks a viewing of the work, bringing the viewer back to reality. 
                        The entire body of work was caught up in the mediation of thoughts and ideas by the receding of visual information, while that is 
                        still present here, the work builds upon my prior techniques with other varieties, such as cyanotypes, transparencies 
                        (as mentioned prior), and other physical ephemera. Represented are the journeys, liberations, and influences upon myself, 
                        and the queer people in my life. In an attempt to discover my own liberation, the work hinges upon two main principles, 
                        the desire to understand the feelings I&apos;ve previously accepted, and how the navigation of the external world will continue from what I&apos;ve 
                        learned. For many friends around me, their relationships with other queer people are a refuge to survive. 
                        <br><br>Note: some images are blurred as they are not safe for the web, and are only viewable in physical shows.</p>

                        Sleepless nights at the cusp of moonlight,<br>
                        among the bouts of tolerant conjecture that metastasized <br>
                        into the fabric of my being.<br><br>

                        We were told that this stretch of day bleeds into the rest,<br>
                        An inescapable fact that our existence creates a danger. <br>
                        That insecurity was a simple satisfaction.<br><br>

                        That was an omen of the past. <br>
                        Bouts of forgiveness plague me now.<br>
                        A great longing was heard, <br><br>

                        and farrowed into nothingness. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
